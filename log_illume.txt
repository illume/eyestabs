Went down to the cafe, because I had no net access at home.

Quickly had a chat to aka, and akalias.



I think we decided to do a musical game of some sort.

The theme is 'the length of a piece of string'.   

Which kind of turns out to be better than 'punk' for our game idea.

One where you can play your real life guitar, and have the pitch detected.

Tonight I want to make a basic prototype, and make some base code.

- intro sequence
    - show some background images, with text on them.
    - play some music.
    - fade between the various parts of text/images.

- a selection screen.
    - which can be used as either character, or level select.
    - you select a part of the screen, and click to go onto that 'level'.

- story board of game idea.

Wrote down some notes, about how things will work.  Using pen and paper, in my little notebook.


- make note tapper interface.
    - given a song, and some note positions, and a note.
