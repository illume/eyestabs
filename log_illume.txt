Went down to the cafe, because I had no net access at home.

Quickly had a chat to aka, and akalias.



I think we decided to do a musical game of some sort.

The theme is 'the length of a piece of string'.   

Which kind of turns out to be better than 'punk' for our game idea.

One where you can play your real life guitar, and have the pitch detected.







2008/09/07 19:05:15 AEST GMT +10

Tonight I want to make a basic prototype, and make some base code.

- intro sequence
    - show some background images, with text on them.
    - play some music.
    - fade between the various parts of text/images.

- a selection screen.
    - which can be used as either character, or level select.
    - you select a part of the screen, and click to go onto that 'level'.

- story board of game idea.




2008/09/07 19:46:08 AEST GMT +10

Wrote down some notes, about how things will work.  Using pen and paper, in my little notebook.


- make note tapper interface.
    - given a song, and some note positions, and a note.
    - 


2008/09/07 19:59:49 AEST GMT +10

Got transitions from intro to top level thing.


2008/09/07 20:33:16 AEST GMT +10


Did some washing...

- make note tapper interface.
    - given a song, and some note positions, and a note.
    - 


Need to set up a test framework.









2008/09/09 07:09:10 AEST GMT +10

starting a quick burst in the morning.

Didn't get anything much done last night.  Was too tired.



2008/09/09 07:19:46 AEST GMT +10

Updated the intro... looks kind of better now.


Now a note tapping interface...


- from [[note,time], ...] 
- display notes across the screen.   
    - total time, eg 30.0 seconds - divided by screen width (640)
        - draw a note at the pos, or an underline.

- display position of time.  As a line from top of screen to bottom.

- You need to tap within a certain amount of error for each note.
    - eg, might be 0.5, or 1.0 seconds.  Need to test, and tweak for good value.





2008/09/09 07:44:29 AEST GMT +10

Got the game going from the intro to NoteGuess part of the game.

Now to display the parts.



2008/09/10 06:34:35 AEST GMT +10


I got SoundAnalyse compiling and installing.  I also made a windows installer for it.




Now to get the noteguess part done.






2008/09/10 06:43:26 AEST GMT +10

a bit of trouble figuring out what to do.

Fixed up main.py which was converted to use constants.py and fastevents


- from [[note,time], ...] 
- display notes across the screen.   
    - total time, eg 30.0 seconds - divided by screen width (640)
        - draw a note at the pos, or an underline.

DONE - display position of time.  As a line from top of screen to bottom.

- You need to tap within a certain amount of error for each note.
    - eg, might be 0.5, or 1.0 seconds.  Need to test, and tweak for good value.






2008/09/10 07:04:42 AEST GMT +10

Got the tapping of lines done ok.  

Except they are placed to the left of the mark... not on the mark.  oh well.


Might also need a line to show more precisely where the note falls.




2008/09/10 07:14:03 AEST GMT +10

Drew a little line under the letters.  It does show it more precisely.

- draw notes, or note underlines they need to play.
- figure out the incoming notes 




Will need to have a set of songs, that people need to play back.







2008/09/11 06:19:49 AEST GMT +10

Nicholas got the pitch detection hooked up to the game.


I tried it with my casio keyboard and built in laptop mic... it seems to work fine :)






2008/09/11 06:38:21 AEST GMT +10

Spent a bit of time making the code look nicer...


Now I need to figure out the different parts.



Areas:

- intro
- doctors surgery.
- note tapping.
    - this will be a club scene.
- club selection.



2008/09/11 06:55:57 AEST GMT +10

spoke to guy about getting our internet connection at home.

... I'm not really sure if that would actually save me time... 
  or if it'd waste coding time on the internet.

Anyway, I think I'll have internet access tonight.  
    Easier than going to a cafe with wireless I guess.


Areas:
- intro
- doctors surgery.
- note tapping.
    - this will be a club scene.
- club selection.


Things you do:
- play notes
- get stabbed in the eye if you get a certain number of notes wrong.
- get cash on winning.   Lose cash getting to gigs.
- get eyeballs.  Lose eyeballs getting them stabbed.




2008/09/11 07:12:48 AEST GMT +10


Started a Player class.  Not much in there at the moment.


- make doctors_surgery.py club_select.py
- note tapping... 
    - show ok interval.   Left and right bars.
    - show when the player gets it correct.



2008/09/11 07:47:47 AEST GMT +10


Whilst making the gig select, and doctors surgery... 

I noted that this could be a gig simulator too.  

Where people can offer you gigs, and you decide which to take or not.  
Some will offer you a rider of 10 beers, and a bowl of soup after the gig... 
  but never give it to you!   Bastards!  Gigs might cost you money.


You can collect myspace friends, and even friendster, and linked-in friends.

You can also collect fans, and stalkers.

- intro
- doctors surgery.
- note tapping.

drew the 'allowed error' markers.




2008/09/13 14:34:48 AEST GMT +10



- detect if the note played is in range
- show fails/passes on the screen
- update the Player class if you lose an eye





2008/09/13 15:37:16 AEST GMT +10

Made a doctor image... and got myself a V.




2008/09/13 18:12:46 AEST GMT +10

We have ocempgui in the same directory as the game now.

Spent ages fucking around with a video we want to include... pygame.movie SUCKS!!!


I'm not sure what the secret is to encode video for it so that it works...

It kind of can be done... but not really.


- make video player that uses jpegs.


Tried to make a video strip of the video... but it killed my poor vista laptop.



Should I bother with this still?   YES!  I have to now... it's taken ages.

I can't wait until we get SDL_ffmpeg working with pygame :)

Getting closer to finishing video player...


talked to nick about gig select screen... 
we're going to come up with 6 gigs, with pictures and text.




2008/09/13 22:10:36 AEST GMT +10

got video player working.



2008/09/13 23:01:08 AEST GMT +10

Drank some wine with a friend who popped by.




- detect if the note played is in range

wasted time trying to get ocempgui widget to move to the right of the screen.


arg!




- doctor screen.
    - fix eye button.
    - show stats ($, spare eyes etc)
    - gig button.

- gig select updates.
    - doctor button.

- when you click the fix eye option, 
    - it should say 'eye has been fixed, thanks!'
- gig button should go to a gig.
