Went down to the cafe, because I had no net access at home.

Quickly had a chat to aka, and akalias.



I think we decided to do a musical game of some sort.

The theme is 'the length of a piece of string'.   

Which kind of turns out to be better than 'punk' for our game idea.

One where you can play your real life guitar, and have the pitch detected.

Tonight I want to make a basic prototype, and make some base code.

- intro sequence
    - show some background images, with text on them.
    - play some music.
    - fade between the various parts of text/images.

- a selection screen.
    - which can be used as either character, or level select.
    - you select a part of the screen, and click to go onto that 'level'.

- story board of game idea.

Wrote down some notes, about how things will work.  Using pen and paper, in my little notebook.


- make note tapper interface.
    - given a song, and some note positions, and a note.
    - 


2008/09/07 19:59:49 AEST GMT +10

Got transitions from intro to top level thing.

Did some washing...

- make note tapper interface.
    - given a song, and some note positions, and a note.
    - 


Need to set up a test framework.

starting a quick burst in the morning.

Didn't get anything much done last night.  Was too tired.



2008/09/09 07:19:46 AEST GMT +10

Updated the intro... looks kind of better now.


Now a note tapping interface...


- from [[note,time], ...] 
- display notes across the screen.   
    - total time, eg 30.0 seconds - divided by screen width (640)
        - draw a note at the pos, or an underline.

- display position of time.  As a line from top of screen to bottom.

- You need to tap within a certain amount of error for each note.
    - eg, might be 0.5, or 1.0 seconds.  Need to test, and tweak for good value.

Got the game going from the intro to NoteGuess part of the game.

Now to display the parts.

I got SoundAnalyse compiling and installing.  I also made a windows installer for it.




Now to get the noteguess part done.






2008/09/10 06:43:26 AEST GMT +10

a bit of trouble figuring out what to do.

Fixed up main.py which was converted to use constants.py and fastevents


- from [[note,time], ...] 
- display notes across the screen.   
    - total time, eg 30.0 seconds - divided by screen width (640)
        - draw a note at the pos, or an underline.

DONE - display position of time.  As a line from top of screen to bottom.

- You need to tap within a certain amount of error for each note.
    - eg, might be 0.5, or 1.0 seconds.  Need to test, and tweak for good value.

Got the tapping of lines done ok.  

Except they are placed to the left of the mark... not on the mark.  oh well.


Might also need a line to show more precisely where the note falls.




2008/09/10 07:14:03 AEST GMT +10

Drew a little line under the letters.  It does show it more precisely.

- draw notes, or note underlines they need to play.
- figure out the incoming notes 




Will need to have a set of songs, that people need to play back.
