        Nathan,
        
        Greetings! I am currently using your great little AudioAnalyse python module for
        a game in PyWeek.
        
        Have you used it for any games? Do you have any more examples other than what
        is posted on google code?
        
        My approach to using the module has been to create a background thread and use
        fastevent to post PITCH_DETECT events.
        
        I am currently using a very simple (probably too simple) heuristic for detecting
        new notes.
        
        If the note is a different pitch or the note is a certain amount louder than the
        previous note then it's a "new" note.
        
        I want to use the module to detect quite precisely when in time each note is 
        started. 
        
        I am using it for a game that uses a guitar as input device.
        
        Do you have any ideas?
        
        Cheers.
